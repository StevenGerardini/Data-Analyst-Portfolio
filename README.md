# Steven Gerardini - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
This repository showcases various projects I've worked on, highlighting my skills in data collection(including web scraping), data wrangling, data exploration, statistical analysis, and data visualization. Each project is completed using a combination of Python, SQL, Excel, and PowerBi.


## Overview
This project analyzes and compares the performance of over 20 different GPUs across several video games. 
Using benchmark data collected from multiple sources, we explore how different GPUs perform in terms of **frame rate** and **1% lows** 
at different resolutions (1080p, 1440p, and 4K), and different graphic settings including **Upscaling**, **Raytracing** and **Frame Generation**.
