# GPU-Benchmark-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes and compares the performance of over 20 different GPUs across several video games. 
Using benchmark data collected from multiple sources, we explore how different GPUs perform in terms of **frame rate** and **1% lows** 
at different resolutions (1080p, 1440p, and 4K), and different graphic settings including **Upscaling**, **Raytracing** and **Frame Generation**.
