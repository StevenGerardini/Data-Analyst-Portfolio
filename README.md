### GPU Performance Analysis 
<u> a </u>


**Description:** This project analyzes and compares the performance of over 20 different GPUs across several video games.
Using benchmark data collected from multiple sources, we explore how different GPUs perform in terms of **frame rate** and **1% lows** 
at different resolutions (1080p, 1440p, and 4K), and different graphic settings including **Upscaling**, **Raytracing** and **Frame Generation**.

**Excel:** [Spreadsheet](https://github.com/StevenGerardini/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/a72868a69e6843f4b45a62a90b8978a3c49f7b67/GPU%20Benchmarks%202024%20Games.xlsx)

**Code:** [Investigating the Impact of Hardware and Settings on Gaming Performance](https://nbviewer.org/github/StevenGerardini/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/GPU%20Performance%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Data Source**: The dataset used for this project was manually curated using an Excel spreadsheet, combining benchmark data from three reputable sources:       
- **TechSpot**: Provides comprehensive GPU reviews and benchmark data across various games and settings. For detailed performance metrics, visit [TechSpot PC Gaming Benchmarks](https://www.techspot.com/features/gaming-benchmarks/).
  
- **Hardware Unboxed**: Offers detailed performance analysis and comparisons of GPUs, including frame rates and performance metrics at different resolutions. Access their reviews and benchmarks on Youtube at [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/@Hardwareunboxed/featured).

- **Tom's Hardware**: Presents detailed rankings of both current and previous-generation graphic cards by performance. Find their comprehensive performance charts at [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html).
  
- **PCPartPicker**: Used to gather pricing data for each GPU model, ensuring accurate cost-per-performance analysis. Visit [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/) for up-to-date pricing information on GPUs and other PC components.

### Collecting Data Using APIs

**Description:** In order to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, an organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements. As a Data Analyst, I will be assisting with this initiative and have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills. My first task was to collect the top programming skills that are most in demand from various sources including:
      - Job postings
      - Surveys
      
**Code**: 
  - [Collecting Jobs Data Using GitHub Jobs API](https://nbviewer.org/github/StevenGerardini/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Collecting%20Job%20Data%20Using%20APIs.ipynb)
  - [Web Scraping Surveys](Web%Scraping%(Capstone).ipynb)
