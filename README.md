## Portfolio Projects


### GPU Performance Analysis


**Description:** This project analyzes and compares the performance of over 20 different GPUs across several video games.
Using benchmark data collected from multiple sources, we explore how different GPUs perform in terms of **frame rate** and **1% lows** 
at different resolutions (1080p, 1440p, and 4K), and different graphic settings including **Upscaling**, **Raytracing** and **Frame Generation**.

**Data Source**: The dataset used for this project was manually curated using an Excel spreadsheet, combining benchmark data from three reputable sources:       
- **TechSpot**: Provides comprehensive GPU reviews and benchmark data across various games and settings. For detailed performance metrics, visit [TechSpot PC Gaming Benchmarks](https://www.techspot.com/features/gaming-benchmarks/).
  
- **Hardware Unboxed**: Offers detailed performance analysis and comparisons of GPUs, including frame rates and performance metrics at different resolutions. Access their reviews and benchmarks on Youtube at [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/@Hardwareunboxed/featured).

- **Tom's Hardware**: Presents detailed rankings of both current and previous-generation graphic cards by performance. Find their comprehensive performance charts at [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html).
  
- **PCPartPicker**: Used to gather pricing data for each GPU model, ensuring accurate cost-per-performance analysis. Visit [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/) for up-to-date pricing information on GPUs and other PC components.

These sources were selected for their reliability and the breadth of data they provide, ensuring a robust analysis of GPU performance.
